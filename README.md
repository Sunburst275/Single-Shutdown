# Single Shutdown
A program to shut down your computer at/after a certain time (-interval or -point).
Its built with C++ and the Qt- Framework, and thus completely free to use and to alter, but please refer to me when making any changes or something.

To download the working executable, see [the download section of my website](https://sunburst275.jimdofree.com/software/single-shutdown/download/).
